# AI-Powered Answer Explanation Feature Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an AI-powered answer explanation feature in the Anki application. The feature will allow users to request AI-generated explanations for flashcard answers during study sessions, helping them better understand both the question and answer through various explanation styles and interactive Q&A.

## Business Context and Problem Statement

### Current State
- Users review flashcards and see questions with answers
- When users don't understand an answer, they must:
  - Leave the study session to research
  - Create mental notes to investigate later
  - Potentially memorize without understanding

### Business Need
- Enhance learning effectiveness by providing instant, contextual explanations
- Reduce cognitive friction during study sessions
- Improve retention through better understanding
- Differentiate the application with AI-powered learning assistance

### Success Metrics
- Increased user engagement (time spent in study sessions)
- Higher retention rates (measured through spaced repetition performance)
- Reduced card suspension rates
- Positive user feedback on explanation quality
- Increased completion rate of study sessions

    cardId: z.string().uuid(),
    questionType: z.enum(["eli5", "example", "importance", "breakdown", "custom"]),
    customQuestion: z.string().max(500).optional(),
    conversationHistory: z.array(z.object({
      question: z.string(),
      answer: z.string(),
    })).max(5).optional(),
  }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Generate contextual explanation
  }),

saveExplanation: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    cardId: z.string().uuid(),
    explanation: z.string(),
    questionType: z.string(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Save explanation to card or separate table
  }),

getExplanationHistory: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    cardId: z.string().uuid(),
  }))
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    // Retrieve saved explanations for a card
  }),
```

### TR2: Data Model Updates

```sql
-- New table for explanation storage
CREATE TABLE card_explanations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  card_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES cards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id STRING NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  question_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  question TEXT,
  explanation TEXT NOT NULL,
  tokens_used INT,
  is_saved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  tags TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  INDEX idx_card_explanations_card_user (card_id, user_id),
  INDEX idx_card_explanations_saved (user_id, is_saved)
);

-- Update AIUsageLog to track explanation usage
-- (Already supports this via 'feature' field - use 'answer_explanation')
```

### TR3: UI Component Architecture

```typescript
// New components structure
components/
  study/
    AnswerExplanation/
      AnswerExplanation.tsx          // Main container
      ExplanationTrigger.tsx          // Click/tap trigger
      PresetOptions.tsx               // Preset question buttons
      CustomQuestionInput.tsx         // Custom question form
      ExplanationDisplay.tsx          // Rendered explanation
      ConversationThread.tsx          // Q&A history
      ExplanationActions.tsx          // Save/share actions
```

### TR4: AI Service Integration

```typescript
// Extend AICardService with explanation methods
class AICardService {
  async explainAnswer(
    card: { front: string; back: string },
    questionType: string,
    customQuestion?: string,
    conversationHistory?: Array<{ question: string; answer: string }>
  ): Promise<{

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Example Interactions

#### Example 1: ELI5 Explanation
**Card**: 
- Q: "What is photosynthesis?"
- A: "The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (glucose) using carbon dioxide and water"

**User clicks**: "Explain like I'm 5"

**AI Response**: 
"Imagine plants are like little chefs with a magical recipe! They take sunlight (like heat from an oven), water from the ground (like water from a tap), and air they breathe (carbon dioxide) to cook up their own food (sugar). This cooking process is called photosynthesis. It's how plants make their own lunch using the sun as their kitchen!"

#### Example 2: Custom Question
**Card**:
- Q: "What is the capital of France?"
- A: "Paris"

**User asks**: "Why did Paris become the capital?"

**AI Response**:
"Paris became France's capital due to several historical factors:

1. **Strategic Location**: Situated on the Seine River, providing trade routes and defense
2. **Royal Power**: French kings made it their seat of power in the Middle Ages
3. **Economic Center**: Grew into the largest city and commercial hub
4. **Cultural Importance**: Became the center of art, education, and culture
5. **Revolutionary Symbol**: Solidified as capital during the French Revolution

The Capetian kings particularly established Paris as the permanent capital in the 12th century, and it has remained so despite brief periods when the government operated elsewhere."
