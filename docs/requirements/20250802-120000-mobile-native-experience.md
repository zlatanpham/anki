# Mobile Native Experience Enhancement Epic

## Executive Summary

This epic outlines the transformation of the Anki AI web application's mobile experience to deliver a native-like mobile application experience. The focus is on optimizing the mobile interface for learning and reviewing flashcards while hiding content management features that are better suited for desktop usage.

## Business Context and Problem Statement

### Current State
The current Anki AI application uses a responsive web design with a sidebar navigation that, while functional on mobile devices, does not provide the optimal user experience for mobile learners. Users accessing the application on mobile devices experience:

- Desktop-oriented navigation patterns (sidebar)
- Exposure to editing and management features that are difficult to use on small screens
- Lack of mobile-optimized UI patterns that users expect from native applications
- Suboptimal touch targets and interaction patterns

### Business Opportunity
Mobile learning represents a significant use case for flashcard applications, as users often want to study during commutes, breaks, or other mobile scenarios. By creating a native-like mobile experience focused on the core learning workflow, we can:

- Increase user engagement and study session frequency
- Improve user satisfaction and retention
- Reduce friction in the mobile learning experience
- Differentiate from competitors with superior mobile UX

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Mobile Users**: Students and learners who primarily access the application via smartphones
- **Development Team**: Engineers responsible for implementing the mobile experience
- **Product Team**: Ensuring the mobile experience aligns with product vision

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Desktop Users**: Ensuring changes don't negatively impact desktop experience
- **Support Team**: May need to address mobile-specific user inquiries

### NFR-4: Responsiveness
- Breakpoint at 768px for mobile/desktop switch
- Support for portrait and landscape orientations
- Adaptive layouts for various mobile screen sizes (320px - 768px)

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users primarily create and edit content on desktop devices
- Mobile usage is primarily for studying and reviewing progress
- Users have modern smartphones with standard screen sizes
- Touch is the primary input method on mobile

### Constraints
- Must maintain the existing desktop experience
- No native mobile app development (web-only solution)
- Must work within the existing Next.js/React architecture
- Limited development resources for mobile-specific features

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Mobile Session Duration**: Increase by 25% within 3 months
- **Mobile Study Completion Rate**: Increase by 30% within 3 months
- **Mobile User Retention**: Improve 7-day retention by 20%
- **Mobile Performance**: Achieve Lighthouse mobile score > 90

### Qualitative Metrics
- User feedback indicating improved mobile experience
- Reduced support tickets related to mobile usability
- Positive app store reviews if PWA is distributed

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Architecture
1. **Responsive Design Strategy**
   - Use CSS media queries for breakpoint management
   - Conditional rendering for mobile-specific components
   - Consider using Next.js dynamic imports for mobile components

2. **State Management**
   - Viewport size detection and storage in context
   - Mobile-specific navigation state management
   - Persistent user preferences for mobile UI

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Create mobile-specific component variants
   - Shared business logic with different presentations
   - Progressive enhancement approach

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (Week 1-2)

  - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, performance budgets, extensive testing

- **Risk**: Navigation paradigm confusion
  - **Mitigation**: User onboarding, intuitive icons, consistent patterns

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Offline study capability with service workers
- Basic card editing for typo corrections
- Voice input for card creation
- Native app wrapper using Capacitor or similar
- Gesture-based interactions for study mode
- Dark mode optimization for mobile

### Long-term Vision
The mobile experience should eventually support a subset of content creation features optimized for mobile use cases, such as quick card creation via voice or photo capture, while maintaining the focus on consumption and learning as the primary mobile use case.
