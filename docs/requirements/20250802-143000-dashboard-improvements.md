# Dashboard Page Improvements - Requirement Specification

## Executive Summary

This document outlines requirements for improving the dashboard page of the Anki-style flashcard learning application. The improvements address two specific issues: incorrect display of onboarding content for returning users with no daily progress, and suboptimal layout of the study session and deck management cards.

## Business Context and Problem Statement

### Current State

The dashboard currently serves as the primary landing page for authenticated users, displaying:
- Study overview metrics (due cards, today's reviews, study streak, total decks)
- Quick action cards for study sessions and deck management
- Progress tracking or onboarding content based on daily review activity

### Problems Identified

1. **Incorrect Onboarding Display**: Users who have previously used the system but haven't completed any reviews today are shown the first-time user onboarding section. This creates a confusing experience for returning users who may have substantial historical activity.

2. **Layout Issues**: The study session and deck management cards span the full width on larger screens (2-column grid), resulting in excessive whitespace and poor visual hierarchy.

### Business Impact

- **User Experience**: Returning users may feel frustrated seeing onboarding content repeatedly
- **User Retention**: Poor layout reduces the professional appearance and usability of the dashboard
- **Engagement**: Misrepresented user status may reduce confidence in the system's accuracy

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Students and learners using the spaced repetition system
- **Product Owner**: Responsible for user experience and engagement metrics
- **Development Team**: Implementing the dashboard improvements

### Stakeholder Interests
- **End Users**: Want accurate representation of their learning journey and efficient access to study features
- **Product Owner**: Seeks improved user retention and engagement metrics
- **Development Team**: Requires clear specifications with minimal architectural changes

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: User Status Determination

**Description**: The system shall accurately determine whether a user is new or returning based on their complete history, not just today's activity.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The system checks for ANY historical reviews across all time periods
- The system checks if the user has created any decks
- The system checks if the user has any cards in their learning queue
- Onboarding content is ONLY shown when ALL of the following are true:
  - User has never completed any reviews (all-time)
  - User has not created any decks
  - User has no cards in any state (NEW, LEARNING, REVIEW)

**Priority**: High

### FR-002: Progress Display Logic

**Description**: The system shall display appropriate content based on the user's complete status.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- If user is determined to be new (per FR-001), show onboarding content
- If user is returning but has no reviews today, show an encouraging message with:
  - Acknowledgment of their return
  - Quick stats from their last study session
  - Call-to-action to resume studying
- If user has reviews today, show today's progress breakdown

**Priority**: High

### FR-003: Dashboard Layout Optimization

**Description**: The study session and deck management cards shall be displayed in an optimal layout across all screen sizes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- On mobile (< 768px): Cards stack vertically (1 column)
- On tablet (768px - 1024px): Cards display side-by-side (2 columns)
- On desktop (> 1024px): Cards integrate into a 3 or 4 column grid with other dashboard elements
- Card height remains consistent regardless of content
- Visual hierarchy emphasizes primary actions

**Priority**: Medium

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance

**Description**: Dashboard improvements shall not degrade loading performance.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Additional data queries complete within 200ms
- Total dashboard load time remains under 1 second
- Caching is utilized where appropriate

### NFR-002: Responsiveness

**Description**: Layout changes shall maintain responsive design principles.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No horizontal scrolling on any device
- Touch targets remain at least 44x44 pixels
- Text remains readable without zooming

### NFR-003: Consistency

**Description**: UI changes shall maintain design system consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Uses existing color schemes and typography
- Maintains consistent spacing and padding
- Follows established component patterns

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users expect the dashboard to remember their complete history
- The existing API endpoints can be extended without breaking changes
- The current authentication system correctly identifies returning users

### Constraints
- Must use existing tRPC API structure
- Cannot modify database schema
- Must maintain compatibility with current Next.js 15 and React 19 setup
- Changes must be backward compatible

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Reduction in bounce rate on dashboard page by 15%
   - Increase in daily active users by 10%

2. **User Experience**
   - Zero reports of incorrect onboarding display for returning users
   - Positive feedback on dashboard layout improvements

3. **Technical Performance**
   - Dashboard load time maintained under 1 second
   - No increase in error rates

## Implementation Considerations

### Technical Approach

1. **User Status Detection**:
   - Add new tRPC endpoint or extend existing `getStudyStats` to include all-time metrics
   - Implement client-side logic to determine user status based on multiple factors
   - Consider caching user status to avoid repeated calculations

2. **Layout Improvements**:
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS grid system with responsive breakpoints
   - Consider using CSS Grid for more complex layouts on larger screens
   - Ensure cards maintain aspect ratio and alignment

### Migration Strategy

1. Feature flag implementation to allow gradual rollout
2. A/B testing to validate improved user engagement
3. Monitoring of key metrics during rollout

### Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - User status determination logic
   - Progress display conditions

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - API endpoint responses
   - Data aggregation accuracy

3. **E2E Tests**:
   - New user flow
   - Returning user scenarios
   - Responsive layout behavior

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Performance degradation from additional queries | High | Medium | Implement efficient queries with proper indexing; use caching |
| Incorrect user classification | High | Low | Comprehensive testing; feature flag for rollback |
| Layout breaks on untested devices | Medium | Low | Extensive device testing; progressive enhancement |

## Future Enhancements

1. Personalized dashboard widgets based on learning patterns
2. Customizable dashboard layout
3. Advanced analytics and insights
4. Social features showing community progress
